# ux-bootcamp-hw17
GT UX/UI Design Bootcamp 2023
HW 17: Code Your Portfolio Homepage (HTML/CSS)

This week’s homework will be the starting place for the rest of the coding section’s homework (weeks 18–21), so do your best! Success during this assignment will set you up to create a beautiful design as you continue to iterate on your portfolio site.

An online portfolio is essential to transitioning to a new career in design. Your online portfolio communicates who you are, your design process, and your work! A portfolio is also a place to practice iterating and applying your growing UX, UI, and front-end web design skills.
